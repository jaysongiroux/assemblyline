<b>Purpose:</b><br>
We were prompted to construct an algorithm that took two and three lane assembly lines and use dynamic programming to find the optimal path. 
<br>
<b>Files:</b>
<br>
main.py - 2 lane
<br>
threelane.py - 3 lane
<br>
<br>
*.txt - contains transition times, process times and enter/exit times.
<br>
<b>Enter/ Exit </b>
the first line in process times is the enter times and the second line in the process times file is the exit times.
